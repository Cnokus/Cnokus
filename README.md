- 👋 Hi, I’m Cnokus
- 👀 I’m interested in creation of a complex diary/notebook app, web-scraping price-comparison app, games and much more.
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Github.
- List of the hard skills I wish to master: Python, Bluetooth synchronisation, Kotlin, Flutter & Dart, Godot & Blockbench & Blender.
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on robotics-related projects and mobile apps' projects, so far, as soon as I gain enough experience and knowledge to provide any meaningful contribution.
